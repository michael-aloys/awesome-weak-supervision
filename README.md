## Introduction

Weak supervision and distant supervision provide ways to (semi-) automatically generate training data for machine learning systems in a fast and efficient manner where normal, supervised training data is lacking. This idea is popular in fields like natural language processing and computer vision and is actively researched. Here, we list interesting papers and tools to help newcomers from both the research and the application side try out weak supervision.

This list was started by the organizers for the [WeaSuL Workshop on Weakly Supervised Learning](https://weasul.github.io/organizers/) at ICLR'21 and we welcome contributions to extend it.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this list, just create a pull-request or a new issue. For a paper or tool, please provide all the necessary information (authors, title, conference, link, topic tags, short description). If you are unsure, feel free to open an issue to discuss it. If you encounter any typos, just let us know. Thanks!

## Surveys

Surveys give a broad overview of a field and can allow you to quickly get insights into current trends and issues for future work.
